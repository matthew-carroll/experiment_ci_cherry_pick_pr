# In general, whenever a change is merged to "main" we want to replicate that change on "stable".
# This GitHub action watches for merges to "main", creates a new branch off of "stable", cherry
# picks the latest commit from "main" to the new branch, and then puts up a PR with the cherry
# pick. At that point, a reviewer waits until all tests pass, and then merges in the cherry pick
# PR.
#
# Sometimes, a change to "main" shouldn't be merged to "stable". In that case, tag the original PR
# with a "no-cherry-pick" label, and this action won't cherry pick that merge.
